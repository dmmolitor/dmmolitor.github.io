I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, where I work with [Deanna Needell](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna/index.html).

I graduated from Colorado College in 2014 with a BA degree in [Mathematics](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/mathematics/).

I am broadly interested in developing and analyzing machine learning algorithms. Recently, I have been studying sketch and project methods for solving large linear systems, data completion for structured data and classification methods using binary data.


At UCLA, I coordinate events for the [Women in Math Group](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math) and  [Women in Math Mentorship Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math). I also served as a graduate student mentor for the [Directed Reading Program](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~drp/). I was an assistant mentor for the Patterns of Lyme Disease group in the 2018 Applied Mathematics Research Experience for Undergraduates at UCLA.
