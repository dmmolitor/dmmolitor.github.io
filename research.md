###### Research Interests
I am interested in randomized iterative methods for optimization and analyzing machine learning algorithms for compressed data. I have studied data completion for structured data, classification methods using binary data, and sketch-and-project methods which include popular optimization methods such as coordinate descent, randomized Kaczmarz and stochastic gradient descent. Recently, I have been investigating extensions of methods for use with tensors.

While a research intern at Google, I built tools to diagnose sources of accuracy loss with integer quantization of machine learning models.
